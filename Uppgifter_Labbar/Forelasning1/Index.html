        <h2>Star Wars</h2>
        <p>
       
            
                The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...<br /> 
                There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. <br /> 
                There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. <br /> 
                Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long...<br /> 
        <br /> 
                He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't<br /> 
                 know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.<br /> 
                 Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?<br /> 
                 Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.<br /> 
                 I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.           <br /> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.<br /> 
            The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set? Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.<br /> 
            What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure.<br /> 
            <br /> 
            Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.<br /> 
            Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him.<br /> 
            He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.<br /> 
            Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.<br /> 
            Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.<br /> 
            I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not.<br /> 
            What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move.<br /> 
            <br /> 
            Several fighters have broken off from the main group.<br /> 
            Come with me! Pull in! Luke...pull in! Watch your back, Luke! Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in! I'm hit, but not bad.<br /> 
            Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there. Red Six... Can you see Red Five? There's a heavy fire zone on this side.<br /> 
            Red Five, where are you? I can't shake him! I'm on him, Luke! Hold on! Blast it! Wedge where are you? Thanks, Wedge. Good shooting, Wedge!<br />
