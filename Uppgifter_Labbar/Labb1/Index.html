                Gardening is one of my favorit things in the World, its relaxing and it makes sence.
                there is a great deal of effort and patience involved in growing your own food and tending to your own little pieace of land.
                After Hours of shoveling, cutting, planting, sour muscles and dirty finger nails you start to se your effort sprout from the ground
                in the form of tiny leaves, reaching for the sun, thats the point where it all gets worth it!

            <h3>Gardening for Dummies!</h3>
            <p>
                to not completly screw your self over and waste your time and energy, there are a couple of things you need to keep in mind.
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt> keep track of the outdoor temperature</dt>
                <dd>if you can <em>keep track of the outdoor temperature at</em> night and during the day, you know when the temperature allows you to start moving your plants into your <mark>garden</mark></dd>

                <dt>Anticipate your plants growth</dt>
                <dd>
                    if your not sowing you seeds directly into the ground, you need to know how long the seeds take to mature and when they are ready for the great outdoors.
                    the <em>timing between sowing and planting</em> is quite important, you need to try and anticipate how big they will be when your gonna plant them outdoors,
                    a older plant will have a better shot at <em>surving the trancition between indoors and outdoors</em> than a seedling.
                </dd>

                <dt>know your pointa of the compass</dt>
                <dd><em>not all plants likes full on sunlight</em>, so its important to know wich parts of your <mark>garden</mark> thats gonna be partialy covered in shadows, and wich parts that wont be covered in shadows at all.</dd>

                <dt>Dont let your plants suffer in the wind</dt>
                <dd>
                    some plants does not care about the wind, but some will produce way less if they are to exposed to the wind.
                    knowing your plants limitations lets you plan where to place them, and make sure they produce as much as possible.
                </dd>

                <dt><strong>POOP</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    may be the most valuable asset for a <mark>garden</mark>. If you can have a steady supply of poop, you will get alot of tasty fruits and vegetables.
                    there is always a farmer or a stable who will let you come and pick up all the poop you need
                </dd>

                <dt>Water is the source of all life</dt>
                <dd>
                    <strong>never let your plants dry out</strong> in most cases its better to watter to often, than to little.
                    its also important to know the chemical properties of your water, some plant wont have a verry happy life if your water contains to much iron,
                    some plant wont have a verry happy life if your water contains to much florides, and some plant wont have a happy life if your watter contains to much chalk.
                    so if you really want to succseed, <strong>have your water analysed</strong> so you know wich plants you will be able to grow.
